## The game

You are a Robin Hood-like **thief** that wants to steal **all the treasure** of a museum and bring them **back** to their **native cultures**.

Sneak in the three different areas of the museum (**Chinese**, **Egyptian** and **Mayan**) and steal all the treasures without being caught by the guards! Be careful! They are very sensitive to the noise that you make!

Oh, and I almost forgot, you have a powerful weapon: 3 coins - use them wisely to distract guards, you can do it!
